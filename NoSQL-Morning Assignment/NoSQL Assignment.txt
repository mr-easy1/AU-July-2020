1. Find all hotels with ratings for Cleanliness>=4

Ans1 Query Approach1:

SELECT type,
       COUNT(1) AS `count`
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE META().id LIKE "hotel%"
    AND reviews[*].ratings[0].Cleanliness>=4
GROUP BY type;

Query Result(JSON): 

[
  {
    "count": 594,
    "type": "hotel"
  }
]

Ans1 Query Approach2:

SELECT t.id, v.ratings.Cleanliness
FROM `travel-sample` t
UNNEST reviews v
WHERE t.type="hotel"
    AND v.ratings.Cleanliness>=4


2. Find the highest airport in each country.

Initially, I have wrongly concluded from this question i.e "Find the highest number of airport from all the available country" whose Query is:

SELECT array_max((SELECT  count(country) as cnt
                  FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "airport"
                  GROUP BY country)[*].cnt);

Query Result(JSON):
[
  {
    "$1": 1560
  }
]


Ans2 Query:
SELECT  country, MAX(geo.alt) AS `MAXIMUM_ALTITUDE`
FROM `travel-sample` t
WHERE t.type="airport"
group by country


Query Result(Table):

MAXIMUM_ALTITUDE  country
6588	          "France"
9078	          "United States"
811	          "United Kingdom"



3. Find all routes operated by Air France from the city of Marseille. (use field faa)

Ans3 Query:

SELECT airline.name as `Airline_Name`, route.sourceairport as `Source_Airport`, route.destinationairport as `Destination_Airport`, route.airline as `Airline`
FROM `travel-sample` route
  JOIN `travel-sample` airline
  ON KEYS route.airlineid
WHERE route.type = "route" and airline.name= "Air France"
AND airline.type = "airline"
AND route.sourceairport = "MRS"
