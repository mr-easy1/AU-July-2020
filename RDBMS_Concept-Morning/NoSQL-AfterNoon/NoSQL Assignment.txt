1. Find all hotels with ratings for Cleanliness>=4

Ans1 Query Approach1:

       COUNT(1) AS `count`
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE META().id LIKE "hotel%"
    AND reviews[*].ratings[0].Cleanliness>=4

2. Find the highest airport in each country.

Initially, I have wrongly concluded from this question i.e "Find the highest number of airport from all the available country" whose Query is:

SELECT array_max((SELECT  count(country) as cnt
                  FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "airport"
                  GROUP BY country)[*].cnt);

Query Result(JSON):
[
  {
    "$1": 1560
  }
]


Ans2 Query:
SELECT  country, MAX(geo.alt) AS `MAXIMUM_ALTITUDE`
FROM `travel-sample` t
WHERE t.type="airport"
group by country


Query Result(Table):

MAXIMUM_ALTITUDE  country
6588	          "France"
9078	          "United States"
811	          "United Kingdom"
