2.Explanation of the below function

var add=(function (){
    var counter=0;
    return function(){return counter +=1;}
})()

add(); //1
add(); //2
add(); //3

Exp: In JavaScript, when a function completes its execution, any variables declared within its body is flushed from the allocated memory.
Here () means we called the function whic we declared just, so "add" will be assigned the return value of the function but this return 
function has access to the var 'counter' Even though the function has returned already,  returned object still reference to the variables
of the function so,these variables will not be destroyed.

Result of which When we call add(), it will access 'counter' variable and increase its value by 1.
